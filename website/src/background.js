    desc: `The journey of a bagmaker who transitions into becoming a Junior Full-stack Software Engineer.On the eve of Christmas, I decided to follow a video tutorial on HTML and CSS on YouTube, while waiting for the turkey to be fully-cooked. After 6 months of learning to code by myself and following tutorials on the internet, I got accepted to join the Bootcamp out of 500+ candidates nationwide. Since this Bootcamp was fully remote, I learnt how to communicate and work successfully as part of a self-directed Agile team. During the Bootcamp, I learnt the fundamentals of Testing, Back-end technologies, and front-end technologies. I was also learning the fundamentals of CyberSecurity in my spare time and attended virtual UX/UI courses taught by professional UI/UX designers.

It includes lots of strategic thinking and when you're up high your life depends on it. The climbing experience has humbled me and provided me an outlet for stress release which helps my mental and physical health.",
