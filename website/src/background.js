    desc: `The journey of a Bagmaker who transitions into becoming a Junior Full-stack Software Engineer.On the eve of Christmas, I decided to follow a tutorial on HTML and CSS on youtube video while waiting for the turkey to be fully-cooked. After 6 months of learning to code by myself and following tutorials on the internet, I got accepted to join a Bootcamp out of 500+ candidates nationwide. since this Bootcamp was fully remote, I learned how to communicate and work successfully as part of a self-direct Agile team. During the Bootcamp, I learned the fundamentals of Testing, Back-end technologies, and front-end technologies. While on the Bootcamp I also learned the fundamental of CyberSecurity in my spare time and learned UX/UI courses thought by professional UI/UX designers.

It includes lots of strategic thinking and when you're up high your life depends on it. The climbing experience has humbled me and provided me an outlet for stress release which helps my mental and physical health.",
